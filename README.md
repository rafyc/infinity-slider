**Welcome Coders and tech lovers of Montreal.**  
We are a group of enthusiastic developers (HTML, CSS, and Javascript) who meet to code, learn, eat and make friends.  
We'll be sharing experiences, creating collaborative projects (just for fun), challenging ourselves with coding games, and most important, expanding our network in a pleasant and friendly environment.

**How does it work?**  
The fun activity last 3 hours (you're more than welcome to stay more if you want). In the first hour, we'll mainly introduce ourselves, chat, and eat, and in the next two hours we'll be engaged in coding and sharing knowledge.

**Notes:**  
- The group is entirely beginner-friendly.  
- If possible, bring your laptop with battery fully charged.  
- Arriving on time is recommended, so you don't miss the introductions and get to know people in this group.

Hows does it sound to you? Excellent, right?!  
See you there.
